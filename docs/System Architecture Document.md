## Components
- **Frontend:** React Native app with Redux Toolkit for state management, handling UI, offline caching, and API interactions.
- **Backend:** Node.js server handling business logic, authentication, and API endpoints.
- **Database:** MongoDB for flexible data storage of users, trips, ratings, and reports.
- **External Services:** Integrations for maps, notifications, and government data.

## Data Flow
1. User actions in app trigger API calls to backend.
2. Backend validates requests, processes data, and queries/updates database.
3. Responses sent back to app, with real-time updates via WebSockets if needed.
4. Reports and photos uploaded to cloud storage.

## Scalability
- Hosted on AWS Johannesburg region for low latency.
- Horizontal scaling for backend servers.
- CDN for static assets.
