# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for SafeDrive Certify

## Problem Statement
In Johannesburg, violent conflicts between traditional minibus taxis and app-based ride services like Uber and Bolt lead to attacks on drivers, hijackings, road blockages, and economic losses. This lack of trust, accountability, and fair rules makes transportation unsafe, especially for lower-income commuters and vulnerable groups like women.
